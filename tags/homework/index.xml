      <description>Last weekend one of my roommates (who was taking his first class in propositional logic) asked me about truth tables. He joked about how tedious and error prone this task is and I should automate the problem. So, partly as a challenge to myself I decide to do it.

But interestingly thinking back I have been automating homework for such a long time.</description>
